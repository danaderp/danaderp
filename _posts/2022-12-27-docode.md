## Introduction

The combination of large amounts of freely available code-related
data, which can be mined from open source repositories, and ever-
more sophisticated Neural Language Model (NLM) architectures
have fueled the development of Software Engineering (SE) tools
with increasing effectiveness. NLMs for code have (seemingly) il-
lustrated promising performance across a range of different SE
tasks [ 12 , 39, 68, 70 ]. In particular, code generation has been an
important area of SE research for decades, enabling tools for down-
stream tasks such as code completion [13 ], program repair [ 10 ], and
test case generation [68 ]. In addition, industry interest in leveraging
NLMs for code generation has also grown as evidenced by tools
just as Microsoft’s IntelliCode [40 ], Tabnine [1], OpenAI’s Codex
[ 73 ], and GitHub’s Copilot [ 19 ]. Given the prior popularity of code
completion engines within IDEs [42], and the pending introduction
of, and investment in commercial tools, NLMs for code generation
will almost certainly be used to help build production software
systems in the near future, if they are not already being used.
