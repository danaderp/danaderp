Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at The College of William & Mary, [SEMERU Research Group](https://www.cs.wm.edu/semeru/people.html) supervised by [Professor Denys Poshyvanyk](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~denys/). My thesis is concentrated on interpretable methods for deep learning code generators, specifically, towards using causal inference to explain deep software generative models. Since 2015 I have been working on different projects as a Software Researcher, including two years in refactoring automation with genetic algorithms; improving the effectiveness of traceability link recovery using Information Retrieval (IR) and Deep Learning (DL); and employing pre-trained models for classifying security issues and requirements. I made an internship in CISCO Systems addressing the problem of understanding vector representation of software artifacts (and their relationships) with information theory. Prior to pursuing a research career, I worked as Software Engineer on back-end applications for three years, which includes one year in a start-up implementing a customizable marketplace that reduces development cost by 45% employing reactive programming and cloud services and, two years, leading the migration and re-engineering of a fiduciary core system used by the biggest banks in Latinoamerica. 

My fields of interest lie in complexity science, neuroevolution, causal reinforcement learning, and interpretable machine learning for the study and automation of software engineer processes. 

On a personal level, I was born in Bogota (Colombia). My first language is Spanish. However, I learned English and German for professional purposes. My hobbies include biking, kayaking, hiking, and (rarely) video games. I also enjoy reading sci-fi literature. My favorite author is Isaac Asimov. Because of my Colombian heritage, I am fond of coffee in all its preparation ways.
