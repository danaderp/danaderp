Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at William & Mary, [SEMERU Research Group](https://www.cs.wm.edu/semeru/people.html) supervised by [Professor Denys Poshyvanyk](https://www.cs.wm.edu/~denys/). My dissertation concentrates on interpretable methods for deep learning code generators, specifically, towards using causal inference to explain deep software generative models. I have been working on different projects as a Software Researcher, including refactoring automation with genetic algorithms; improving the effectiveness of traceability link recovery using Information Retrieval (IR) and Deep Learning (DL); and employing pre-trained models for classifying security issues and requirements. 

During my internship at CISCO Systems, I delved into the utilization of vector representation and information theory to understand software artifacts’ relationships. At Microsoft Corporation, I developed an interpretability method to comprehend neural code models. My research background is complemented by years of software engineering experience, mainly focused on back‑end applications. Currently, I’m pursuing opportunities that enable me to utilize my expertise in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and causal inference research roles, primarily concentrated on software engineering research.

My fields of interest lie in complexity science, neuroevolution, causal learning, and interpretable machine learning for the study and automation of software engineer. 

On a personal level, I was born in Bogota (Colombia). My first language is Spanish. However, I learned English and German for professional purposes. My hobbies include biking, kayaking, hiking, and (rarely) video games. I also enjoy reading sci-fi literature. My favorite author is Isaac Asimov. Because of my Colombian heritage, I am fond of coffee in all its preparation ways.
