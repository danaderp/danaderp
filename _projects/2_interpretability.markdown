According to Molnar, we can envision 5 different purposes (or in a practical scenario "applications") of Machine Learning Interpretability. These common "applications" are:
1. Debugging a model
2. Making stakeholders trust the model
3. Auditing
4. Offering recourse
5. Generating insights (explanations)

We can extend this applications to the intersection of deep learning and software engineeering (DL4SE). 

## First Application: Debugging a model

## Second Application: Trust a Model

## Third Application: Auditing

## Fourth Application: Offering Recourse

## Fifth Application: Generating Insights (Explanations)
